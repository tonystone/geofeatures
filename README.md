## Introduction

GeoFeatures is a lightweight, high performance geometry library for Objective-C.  It supports the full
 set of geometric primitives such as Point, Polygon, and LineString as well as collection classes such as MultiPoint, MultiPolygon,and MultiLineString.

## Features

- [x] Easy to use.
- [x] Point, MultiPoint, LineString, MultiLineString, Polygon, MultiPolygon, Box and GeometryCollection implementations.
- [x] Area, Length, BoundingBox, Centroid, Perimeter, Intersects, Intersection, Difference, Union, and Within (point in polygon) algorithms.  More coming soon.
- [x] Immutable and mutable versions of all classes (e.g. `GFPolygon` and `GFMutablePolygon`).
- [x] [WKT (Well-Known-Text)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text) input and output.
- [x] [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) input and output.
- [x] MapKit representations and drawing.
- [x] Indexed Subscripting support for all collection types (e.g. `GEPoint * point = multiPoint[0]`).
- [x] **Swift**: supports direct use in Swift applications.
- [x] CocoaPod framework support (compile as Objective-C framework or static lib).
- [x] Open Sourced under the the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).
- [x] Comprehensive doxygen documentation of the library available at [github.io](http://tonystone.github.io/geofeatures).
- [x] Implemented based on the popular and fast open source C++ boost geometry library.
